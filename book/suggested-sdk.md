which SDK , libs or API endpoints , you suggest for this purpose , think of giving me package.json dev dependencies


Okay, let's craft a `package.json` with the necessary dependencies for building our TON-integrated Telegram Web App with Next.js, Postgres, and TON Connect. I'll also elaborate on why each dependency is included.

```json
{
  "name": "ton-twa-dapp",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "db:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
    "db:generate": "prisma generate"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@emotion/react": "^11.11.1",
    "@emotion/styled": "^11.11.0",
    "@mui/material": "^5.14.12",
    "@next/font": "13.5.4",
    "@prisma/client": "^5.3.1",
    "@telegram-apps/sdk": "^6.2.1",
    "axios": "^1.5.1",
    "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
    "next": "13.5.4",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "@tonconnect/sdk": "^2.0.0",
    "ton": "^13.4.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "20.8.2",
    "@types/react": "18.2.24",
    "@types/react-dom": "18.2.9",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.16",
    "eslint": "8.50.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "13.5.4",
    "postcss": "^8.4.31",
    "prisma": "^5.3.1",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.3",
    "typescript": "5.2.2"
  }
}
```

**Dependencies Explained:**

*   **`@emotion/react` and `@emotion/styled`:**  These libraries are used to create reusable and styled components in the React application. Together they provide easy way to style the application with a modern approach.
*   **`@mui/material`:** MUI (Material-UI) is a popular React UI library that provides ready-to-use components, which we will use to accelerate UI development with ready made high quality components.
*   **`@next/font`**: Provides the way to optimize fonts in next.js apps.
*   **`@prisma/client`:** The client library generated by Prisma (an ORM) for database interaction. It provides a type-safe way to work with Postgres.
*   **`@telegram-apps/sdk`:** The *official* Telegram Web Apps SDK. We'll use it for interacting with the Telegram UI, setting the main button, getting theme data, and more. If you prefer the community SDK for easier development you can replace this with `"twa-dev/sdk"`.
*   **`axios`:** A widely used HTTP client for making requests to our backend API from the TWA.
*   **`dotenv`:**  Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file. Important for managing sensitive information (like database credentials, API keys, etc.).
*   **`next`:** The core Next.js framework for building React applications. It provides server-side rendering, routing, API routes, and much more.
*  **`react` and `react-dom`:** The core React libraries necessary to build the user interface.
*   **`@tonconnect/sdk`:**  The official library to work with TON Connect. It helps establishing secure connections between user wallets and our app to authorize transactions.
*  **`ton`:**  The official TON JavaScript library for interacting directly with the TON blockchain.

**Dev Dependencies Explained:**

*   **`@types/node`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`:** TypeScript type definitions for Node.js, React, and React DOM.
*   **`autoprefixer`, `postcss`, `tailwindcss`:**  Tools for working with CSS. We will use tailwind css for styling components.
*   **`eslint`, `eslint-config-next`:** Tools to configure a linter and keep the code formatting consistent.
*   **`prisma`:** The Prisma CLI for database migrations, schema management, and generating the Prisma client library.
*   **`typescript`:**  The TypeScript compiler.

**API Endpoints & Considerations:**

While this `package.json` doesn't list API endpoints (as those will be your custom Next.js API routes), here are some that you'll likely need in `pages/api`:

*   **`/api/auth/telegram`:**
    *   To check and authenticate Telegram user data when the app loads and secure the API endpoints.
*   **`/api/data`:**
    *   `GET` - Fetches data needed for the application UI from the Postgres database.
    *   `POST` - Saves data from the TWA into Postgres.
    *   `PUT` - Updates data in Postgres.
    *   `DELETE` - Removes data from Postgres.
*   **`/api/ton/read`:**
    *   `POST` - Fetches data from the TON blockchain (e.g., balances, NFTs, contract data).
*   **`/api/ton/send`:**
     *   `POST` - Creates a transaction and securely sends it to the TON blockchain using the user's wallet and the server-side logic.
*   **`/api/ton/wallet/connect`:**
    *   `POST` - For handling the connection with the TON Connect.

**Key Points:**

*   **TON Library Choice:** We're using the official `ton` library. You might need other libraries based on the specific smart contract functionality you're using (e.g., if you're working with a specific NFT contract).
*   **Frontend vs Backend:** The `package.json` includes dependencies for both the client-side TWA (React, Next.js, SDKs) and the server-side API (Next.js API routes, Prisma, TON libraries).
*   **Environment Variables:**  Make sure to use `.env` files to securely store secrets (DB connection strings, API keys, etc.). Don't commit these files to your version control.
* **Prisma:** We are using prisma as our ORM to make queries to the database.
*   **TypeScript:** It's recommended that you use TypeScript for strong typing, better developer experience and a cleaner codebase.
*   **UI Library:** we will use Material-UI components to create our user interface.
*   **Dependency updates** Make sure you keep your dependencies up to date to get the latest performance and security updates.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Create a new Next.js project:** `npx create-next-app my-twa-ton-app` (you can use yarn or pnpm).
2.  **Navigate to your project directory:** `cd my-twa-ton-app`.
3.  **Replace your `package.json`** content with the code above.
4.  **Run `npm install` or `yarn install`** (or `pnpm install`).
5.  **Create your .env file**, and fill the necessary secrets.
6.  **Start implementing your TWA and the API endpoints.**

This `package.json` should give you a solid starting point for your TON-integrated TWA project. You may need to add other dependencies as you expand functionality, but this covers the essentials.
