Other than our server side logic , I mean nextjs powered by postgres , we need also communicated with ton blockchain , either client side or server side , also we need anyway communication with user wallet , mainly with ton connect protocol , so , our playground or overall glue also is telegram, and bot api , whould you please give me verbose prompt to craft comprehensive book outlne to explain , demonestrate and toturial these technolgies ?
