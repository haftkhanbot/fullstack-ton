what is @ in import ReferralSystem from '@/components/ReferralSystem'

In the context of the import statement `import ReferralSystem from '@/components/ReferralSystem'`, the `@` symbol represents an **alias** that points to the **source directory** of your project.

Here's a breakdown:

* **`import ReferralSystem from ...`**: This is a standard JavaScript import statement that's importing a component named `ReferralSystem` from a specific file path.
* **`'@'`**: This symbol is not standard JavaScript. It's a convention, typically used in projects that utilize build tools like **Webpack, Vite, or Create React App (CRA)**. It acts as a shortcut or alias for the root directory containing your application's source code.
* **`'/components/ReferralSystem'`**: This is the relative path starting from the source directory (`@`) to the `ReferralSystem` component.

**Why use `@`?**

* **Absolute Path Simplification:** Without `@`, you might need to use lengthy relative paths like `'../../../../components/ReferralSystem'`. As your project grows, these relative paths become hard to manage and prone to errors. `@` provides a cleaner and consistent way to access modules throughout the project.
* **Improved Maintainability:** If you reorganize your directory structure, you only need to change the mapping of `@` in your build tool's configuration, rather than updating all import statements across your codebase.
* **Clarity and Consistency:** Using `@` makes it immediately clear that you are referring to a path rooted at the source directory, improving the readability of your import statements.

**How does it work under the hood?**

Usually, your build tool's configuration file (e.g., `webpack.config.js`, `vite.config.js`, or `jsconfig.json`/`tsconfig.json` in CRA) contains settings that define the alias for `@`. This configuration tells the bundler to interpret `@` as the specific path of your source folder (usually `src`).

**In summary:**

`@` is a shortcut or alias for your project's source directory, enabling cleaner and more manageable import statements. It is not a standard JavaScript feature but a convention provided by build tools and configured for use in your projects.

**Example:**

If your project structure looks like this:

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ReferralSystem.js
│   └── pages/
│        └── HomePage.js
└── ...
```

And your build tool is configured so that `@` points to `src/`, then in `HomePage.js` you can use `import ReferralSystem from '@/components/ReferralSystem'`, which is equivalent to `import ReferralSystem from '../components/ReferralSystem'`. This is great because you don't need to worry about the relative path if you move `HomePage.js` later within your source code.

Therefore, the import statement `import ReferralSystem from '@/components/ReferralSystem'` imports the `ReferralSystem` component from the `components/ReferralSystem` file located within your source directory.
